# Metrics Evaluation

In this folder, you will find the code used to retrieve the objective metrics. To assess the performance of the different models, evaluation was conducted in two primary domains: *audio quality* and *real-time embeddability*.

## Folder Structure

- **frechet_audio_distance**: Contains the code for the computation of Frechet Audio Distance (*audio quality*).
- **embeddability**: Contains the code used to evaluate the suitability of the models for real-time application on embedded systems (*embeddability*).
